      I have extensive experience in engineering, data science, product
      development, and entrepreneurship. I started my career in roles at
      Accenture and Braintree Payments, where I honed my skills in software
      development and data science. Later, as a product manager and principal
      data scientist at a startup InsightSquared, I created analytical software
      products which served thousands of users worldwide. At InsightSquared, I
      was also responsible for crafting a product vision and successfully
      executing a go-to-market strategy to bring these tools to customers.

      While completing my MBA at Carnegie Mellon Unviersity, I developed skills
      in all things related to startups, entrepreneurship, and venture capital.
      Recently, I co-founded two startups in the data science/machine learning
      and devtools spaces. I looks forward to leveraging his experiences to
      helping startups grow and scale successfully.

      When I'm not geeking out about the latest tech trends, you will find me
      spending time with my family. We enjoy hiking, kayaking, running, and just
      being outdoors in general. I also love to read, watch action movies, and
      am a big fan of all different forms of comedy.
