I've often thought about starting some kind of personal site/blog/portfolio. But it's one of those things that I never really got around to actually doing. It has been one of those things that I've wanted to do but never had the time. Then things in my life would eventually come up where I would kick myself for not starting that blog before I.... (started my company, had a kid, started in venture, got an MBA, etc.). Then I would often think to myself "oh well it's too late" and even after again realizing those things I don't end up changing my behavior. 

Recently though, I think I have finally come to realize that there is no "right time" for a lot of things in life. There just happens to be the "time that you actually get around to doing it". That's how I've decided to recently treat this site. I have finally gotten around to putting my personal site together. 

I'll mostly be using this to share some of my thoughts/ideas related to interesting trends that I see in startups and VC. But I'll also use this to share some interesting work that I have found or am doing on data science/ML, software development, crypto/web3, or just random things that I am thinking. This site will be purely to share my own personal thoughts/experiences. I hope that some of it is helpful/interesting in some way. 

If you ever want to chat more about anything that I am writing, please feel free to <nuxt-link style="color: #689dbb; text-decoration: underline;" to="/contact">drop me a note</nuxt-link>. I am always happy to chat with people interesting in talking with me.

Thanks for reading!
