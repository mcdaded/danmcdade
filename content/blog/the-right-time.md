I've often thought about starting some kind of personal site/blog/portfolio. But it's one of those things that I never really got around to actually doing. It has been one of those things that I've wanted to do but never had the time. Then things in my life would eventually come up where I would kick myself for not starting that blog before I.... (started my company, had a kid, started in venture, got an MBA, etc.). Then I would often think to myself "oh well it's too late" and even after again realizing those things I don't end up changing my behavior. 

Recently though, I think I have finally come to realize that there is no "right time" for a lot of things in life. There just happens to be the "time that you actually get around to doing it". That's how I've decided to recently treat this site. I have finally gotten around to putting my personal site together.
